# Wiki CLI

Search Wikipedia and read summaries directly in your terminal!

## Usage

```
# The first step is obvious...
npm i -g wiki-cli

# Then, just call `wiki` alone to enter the interactive mode...
wiki

# You can read the not so helpful help page with option `-h` or `--help`...
wiki -h
```

## Why

I love CLI, and Ink is awesome! Also, who doesn't want to read Wikipedia in the terminal? ;)

This was also a more advanced version of the demo app that I used for my talks on building CLIs. Here are the videos: [lightning talk at React Day Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWYYB-4zeR0) and [meetup talk at TypeScript Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZly1SPIhfY).
